Did:
1. Need to try to do all the data input and transformation as ints, _then_
   convert to halfs on device.
2. Previously thought that convert_int_to_half() was calling the same indices multiple times.
   Turned out that I was just confused and looking at the output of both A.txt and B.txt

To Do:
1. fix warp misaligned address
